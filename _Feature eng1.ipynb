    "# QUES.1 What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "# ANSWER \n",
    "# In feature selection, the filter method is a type of technique that selects features based on their statistical properties\n",
    "# and scores. It evaluates each feature independently of the others and ranks them according to certain criteria. The goal is\n",
    "# to identify the most relevant features for a particular task, such as classification or regression, and discard less\n",
    "# important or redundant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's a general overview of how the filter method works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Feature Scoring: Each feature is assigned a score based on its statistical properties or correlation with the target\n",
    "# variable. Common scoring metrics include chi-squared test, mutual information, correlation coefficient, ANOVA \n",
    "# (Analysis of Variance), and others, depending on the nature of the data (categorical or numerical) and the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Ranking Features: Features are then ranked according to their scores. Higher scores indicate greater importance or \n",
    "# relevance to the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Selection Threshold: A threshold is set to determine which features to keep and which to discard. Features with scores\n",
    "# above the threshold are retained, while those below it are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Feature Subset: The selected subset of features is used for training the machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages of the filter method include simplicity and efficiency, as it doesn't require the training of a model to evaluate\n",
    "# feature importance. However, it may overlook interactions between features since it evaluates them independently."

    "# QUES.2 How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "# ANSWER The Wrapper method and the Filter method are two different approaches to feature selection in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Filter Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "# * Objective: Filter methods evaluate the relevance of features based on some statistical measure, such as correlation,\n",
    "# mutual information, or variance, without involving a specific machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "# * Independence: These methods are independent of the chosen machine learning algorithm. They assess feature importance\n",
    "#  before the actual learning process.\n",
    "# * Computational Efficiency: Filter methods are generally computationally less expensive compared to wrapper methods since \n",
    "# they don't involve training a model during the feature selection process.\n",
    "# * Pros and Cons: They are computationally efficient but may not capture the interaction between features as they assess each\n",
    "# feature independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Wrapper Method:\n",
    "# * Objective: Wrapper methods use a specific machine learning algorithm to evaluate the performance of different subsets of \n",
    "# features. It involves training and evaluating the model iteratively with different sets of features.\n",
    "# * Dependence: The selection of features is tightly integrated with the performance of a specific learning algorithm.\n",
    "# Computational Efficiency: Wrapper methods can be computationally expensive because they involve training and evaluating\n",
    "# the model multiple times for different subsets of features.\n",
    "# * Pros and Cons: They are more powerful in capturing the interactions between features and their impact on the model's\n",
    "# performance. However, they can be computationally intensive and may lead to overfitting if not used carefully.\n",

    "# In summary, the main difference lies in the approach:\n",
